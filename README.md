# WesBos-Drumkit
Coded along the WesBos tutorial, this project is a simple exercise to try event listeners in JavaScript, although I couldn't help but add some new stuff.

Improvements:
- Make the site responsive
    · Play sound by also clicking the buttons
    · Wrap flex buttons

TODO:
- Change styles of entire site
    · Blur background image
    · Change colors
    · Reduce image size
- Change favicon
